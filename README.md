User Stories for Flashcards Project:

1) As the parent of a school-aged child, I want online, computer-housed flashcards which cannot be mangled, destroyed or lost.

2) As the parent of a school-aged child or as a self-directed student myself, I want to control the progression of the flashcards after I've given a correct or incorrect answer so that I can create a customized learning experience for my child or myself.

3) As a user of the flashcards, I want the ability to change out their content so they can display the content I most want or need to learn at the time I use them.

4) As a user of the flashcards, I want to able to create a history of my correct and incorrect answers so I may track my progress in learning the material on the cards.

5) As a user of the flashcards who's on the go, I want a version of the flashcards that easily loads and displays on my mobile device so I can test myself during commutes, lunches and any opportunity where I have a moment or two.
